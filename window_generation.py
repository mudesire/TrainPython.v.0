#  Windows are increasing bottom up and start in the lower left corner.
    
    # Inputs:
# xy_local      Local grid, recomended to be rotated to reduce number of windows
#               outside the dataset, specified as a 2 column matrix in km.
# Optional inputs:
# iterate           A struct containign vairables that are computed for the
#                   first run and whicha re not recompeted for the other runs.
#                   This includes:
#                   window_ix: a variable struct containing which points 
#                               are in wich window.
#                   window_xy: the window positions that cover the data
#                   window_xy_extra: the window positions of the bounding box 
#                               around the data.
# crop_flag     	Set to 'y' to crop out an area. By default this is not done.
#               	When 'y': Filename = "area_ex.mat", with variable called lonlat.
#               	Use: lonlat=ginput; to select polygon around the to be cropped (out) area.
#               	Save as: save('area_ex.mat','lonlat');
